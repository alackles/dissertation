Evolution sheds light on all of biology, and evolutionary dynamics underlie some of the most pressing issues we face today.  
If we can deepen our understanding of evolution, we can better respond to these various challenges.
However, such processes directly can be difficult; biological data is naturally messy, easily confounded, and often limited. 
Fortunately, we can use computational modeling to help simplify and systematically untangle complex evolutionary processes.
The aim of this dissertation is therefore to develop innovative computational frameworks to describe, quantify, and build intuition about evolutionary phenomena, with a focus on connectivity within evolvable systems. 
Here I introduce three such computational frameworks which provide insight into evolutionary phenomena at the genotype, phenotype, and landscape level.
These methods and metrics expand our computational toolkit for studying evolution across scales.
