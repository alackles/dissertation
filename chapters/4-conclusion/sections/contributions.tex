\section{Contributions}

In summary, this dissertation makes the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In \textbf{Chapter \ref{ch:re}}, I developed a rank-based metric for measuring genome connectivity that does not rely on underlying assumptions of baseline interaction. This model was able to correctly identify when loci were non-interactive in a case where existing metrics failed.
    \item In \textbf{Chapter \ref{ch:chm}}, I introduced the comparative hybrid method, an analytic tool for comparing computational cognitive structures. Using this method, I showed that connectivity and discretization are important components in the evolution of associative learning.
    \item In \textbf{Chapter \ref{ch:vr-viz}}, I describe Tessevolve, a platform for visualizing and exploring fitness landscapes in up to four dimensions. Tessevolve expands our current ability to view and manipulate landscapes visually and allows us to view how patterns of ruggedness and mutational landscape connectivity change across dimensions.
