\section{Introduction}

In this dissertation, I introduced three new methods and metrics for investigating connectivity in evolvable systems at the genotype, phenotype, and landscape levels. 
Each of these new metrics provided insight into their respective systems that existing metrics obfuscated or failed to detect. 
Together, these new models represent both quantitative and qualitative improvements towards our understanding of key evolutionary processes.
