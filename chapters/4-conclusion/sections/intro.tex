\section{Introduction}

In this dissertation, I introduced three new methods and metrics for investigating connectivity in evolvable systems at the genotype, phenotype, and landscape levels. 
Each of these new methods provided insight into their respective systems that existing techniques obfuscated or failed to detect. 
Together, these new tools represent both quantitative and qualitative improvements towards our understanding of key evolutionary processes.
