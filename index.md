### How

If I sent you this page, it's probably because you're my friend or family from outside academia. Hi!

My dissertation defense is an hour long presentation summarizing the work I've done for my PhD. It's an open presentation to the public, so anyone can come join. 

After the public portion, everyone will leave except my committee (a group of four experts in my general area of research). They'll talk to me for about another hour or two to better assess what I've learned and what I plan to do with that knowledge. Then, they'll decide whether or not I've earned the title of Dr. Ackles!

### What

#### The Academic Version

Evolution sheds light on all of biology, and evolutionary dynamics underlie some of the most pressing issues we face today. If we can deepen our understanding of evolution, we can better respond to these various challenges. However, studying such processes directly can be difficult; biological data is naturally messy, easily confounded, and often limited. Fortunately, we can use computational modeling to help simplify and systematically untangle complex evolutionary processes.The aim of this dissertation is therefore to develop innovative computational frameworks to describe, quantify, and build intuition about evolutionary phenomena, with a focus on connectivity within evolvable systems. Here I introduce three such computational frameworks which provide insight into evolutionary phenomena at the genotype, phenotype, and landscape level. These methods and metrics expand our computational toolkit for studying evolution across scales.

#### In Layman's Terms

I think understanding how evolution works on a nuts-and-bolts level is really important for understanding a lot of different worldly problems related to biology: things you've probably heard a lot about, like how species will respond to climate change and how viruses respond to vaccines. A lot of what makes those problems difficult to solve is how many moving parts are involved, and how those parts connect. I don't study those connections directly, though: I'm interested in building general tools to help other people solve their specific questions related to complicated systems. My research is about creating new tools to analyze evolution, testing how well those tools work, and introducing them to a broad audience who might be able to use them to address whatever important questions we as humans have as a whole.


### More Q+A

**Q:** Is it possible you'll fail?  
**A:** Ouch!! Technically, yes. Failure is always an option. But dissertation defenses typically only go forward if your advisor is confident in your ability to make the leap, and the public portion is typically a celebration of the culmination of years of work. So please don't worry!

**Q:** Is there a dress code or anything?  
**A:** Nope! Just show up in whatever!

**Q:** Are you doing anything fun after the presentation?  
**A:** There will be a happy hour in person afterwards around 3 PM. (Unless I fail, like you rudely suggested. Then it'll be a sad hour.) Location TBD.

**Q:** [How big will the snake be?](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/faq-the-snake-fight-portion-of-your-thesis-defense)  
**A:** I haven't seen the snake yet, so I can't assess its size. However, Emily has told me it is unlikely to be venomous.

**Q:** What next?  
**A:** This fall, I'm starting a job as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. Come visit me!
